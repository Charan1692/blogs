# What is imposter syndrome? 
Imposter syndrome is the feeling that you don't belong here. It is the feeling of being amongst an incredibly smart group of people and feeling that you don't deserve a seat at the table, that it was a mistake you ended up here, that your success is a fluke. 
If you have been feeling like this, you are not alone. <STATS>


# Dealing with imposter syndrome in the moment.
Dealing with imposter syndrome can become manageable with a little patience, self-understanding and self-love. Here are some tips that have helped me manage my imposter syndrome - 

- Know that usually overachieving people experience imposter syndrome <REWORD>
- Make a list of accomplishments you have had so far in your life, and list things you are really proud of. Now make a list of things that challenged you in the last year, and you were able to overcome. These lists are a proof you are capable of amazing things. 
- Often, sharing about how you feel with others makes it easier to overcome feeling like an imposter. Here are some people who can help - 
    - a friend in your support group who makes you feel good about yourself.
    - a colleague you have a good relationship with and worked with in the past.
    - your mentor 
    - a professional psychiatrist. 
- Stepping away from the situation helps in disconnecting and feeling better. Here are some ways to disconnect - 
    - Take a breather. Relax. Go for a walk.
    - Workout. Do some heavy cardio. Do some light yoga.
    - Do some self-care - take a bath, light a candle, do a spa session.
- Do something creative. Some things to do - music, paint, knit, read, write a blog, write a novel. Creativity helps your brain unclog and gives you the confidence of producing your craft.
- I have noticed that when friends and co-workers tell me about their feelings of an imposter, I am shocked. Because in my mind, they are the most proficient and prolific developers. "How is it possible for them to feel like an imposter?" - is what goes through my head. In those moments, I have reminded myself that even the most amazing <CHANGE> developers feel like an imposter from time to time. Coincidently <CHANGE>, when I go through the same feelings, it has helped me to think about these exact moments.<REWORD>
    - What are some achievements you have had in past you are really proud of? If you were hiring someone with these achievements, how proud would you feel to have them on your team?
    - If your friend was in a similar situation and talking to you about their imposter syndrome, what would you tell them? How would you comfort them?  Now tell that to yourself. Be your own best friend.
    - If your co-worker who you admire was having imposter syndrome, what would you tell them? Now tell that to yourself. Be your own secret admirer. 
    - What would your future 5 year self tell you at this moment?


# Prepare for impending imposter syndrome.
