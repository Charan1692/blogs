# Bootcamp: Becoming a web developer in 2021. 

I have been a front end dev for over 7 years now. I worked the first two years as a freelance developer, co-founder of my Web development agency - World Web Warriors, and then accepted a job as a professional web developer at Telus Communications in Vancouver, Canada for three years. In 2017, I moved to sunny California and started working as a Software Engineer at PIX Systems, San Francisco. Most recently, I have been working at PayPal Inc for the last three years. These years have been really rewarding. Of all these years, my favourite moments have been the ones when I was solving deep technical problems since these are the ones that got me most nervous in the moment and after I was done, gave me a huge sense of achievement. There is a great joy in overcoming your deepest fears and treading deep waters. 

I know that a lot of you want or know someone who wants to start learning coding. Someone who is too afraid to take this bold move, someone who thinks that coding is hard and not sure if they are the right fit. This article is for them! It is for that budding web developer who is too scared to open the code editor and start coding because they are afraid they may get stuck, and there would be no way out. I am here to tell you - You got this! 

In this article, I will dive into the resources with the least committment to get started, a proposed schedule of getting started, and a list of resources to watch to stay yourself in the know-how of web development.
