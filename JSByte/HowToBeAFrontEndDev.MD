# Bootcamp: Becoming a web developer in 2021 and getting a job as a web developer.

I have been a web developer for over 7 years now. I worked the first two years as a freelance developer, then as co-founder and CTO of my web development startup - World Web Warriors, and then accepted a job as a professional web developer at TELUS Communications in Vancouver, Canada for three years. In 2017, I moved to sunny California and started working as a Software Engineer at PIX Systems, San Francisco. Most recently, I have been working at PayPal Inc for the last three years. These 7 years have been really rewarding. Of all these years, my favourite moments have been the ones in which I was totally freaked out by the sheer size of technical problem at hand. It is  because after I was done with these problems, these were the challenges that gave me a huge sense of achievement - not only in my technical abilities, but also in personal abilities to persevere. There is a great joy in overcoming your deepest fears and treading deep waters.

I know that a lot of you want or know someone who wants to start learning web development or coding in general. Perhaps you are too afraid to take this bold move, perhaps you think that coding is hard and not sure if you are the right fit. Maybe you are too scared to open the code editor and start coding because you are afraid you may get stuck and lose motivation, or you don't know where to get started in the vast sea of knowledge. I am here to tell you - You got this! We will get through this together!

Back end development is the development of software that facilitates user interface such as building APIs and uses back end technolgoies such as NodeJS.
