# Bootcamp: Becoming a web developer in 2021. 

I have been a web developer for over 7 years now. I worked the first two years as a freelance developer, then as co-founder and CTO of my web development startup - World Web Warriors, and then accepted a job as a professional web developer at Telus Communications in Vancouver, Canada for three years. In 2017, I moved to sunny California and started working as a Software Engineer at PIX Systems, San Francisco. Most recently, I have been working at PayPal Inc for the last three years. These years have been really rewarding. Of all these years, my favourite moments have been the ones when I was solving deep technical problem and felt super nervous in the moment because after I was done, these were the challenges that gave me a huge sense of achievement. There is a great joy in overcoming your deepest fears and treading deep waters. 

I know that a lot of you want or know someone who wants to start learning web development or coding in general. Perhaps you are too afraid to take this bold move, perhaps you think that coding is hard and not sure if you are the right fit.
