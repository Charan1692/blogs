I have been a front end dev for over 7 years now. I worked the first two years as a freelance dev, co-founder of my Web development agency - World Web Warriors, then as a professional developer at Telus Communications in Vancouver, Canada for three years. In 2017, I moved to sunny California and started working as a software engineer at PIX systems, San Francisco. Most recently, I have been working at PayPal Inc. Of all these years, my most favourite moments have been solving deep technical problems - usually the ones that get me most nervous in the moment. There is some joy in overcoming your deepest fears, and after that you come out triumphant. 

I know that a lot of you want or know someone who wants to start learning coding. Someone who is too afraid to take this bold move, someone who thinks that coding is hard and not sure if they are the right fit. This article is for them! This article is for that budding front end developer who is too scared to open the laptop and start coding because they are afraid they may get stuck, and there would be no way out. I am here to tell you - I have got you! 

In this article, I will dive into the resources with the least committment to get started, a proposed schedule of getting started, and a list of resources to watch to stay yourself in the know-how of web development. This plan is going to be focussed on getting you a job, and therefore project-heavy.

6. Step 4.0: Rate the inspirations.
7. Step 4: Implement the framework. - build an inspiration. 
8. Step 5: Learn a library for the framework. 
9. Step 6: Step up challenge - learn the other side of stack(front-end vs back-end)
