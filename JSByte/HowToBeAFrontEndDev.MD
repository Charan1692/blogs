# Bootcamp: Becoming a web developer in 2021 and getting a job as a web developer.

I have been a web developer for over 7 years now. I worked the first two years as a freelance developer, then as co-founder and CTO of my web development startup - World Web Warriors, and then accepted a job as a professional web developer at TELUS Communications in Vancouver, Canada for three years. In 2017, I moved to sunny California and started working as a Software Engineer at PIX Systems, San Francisco. Most recently, I have been working at PayPal Inc for the last three years. These 7 years have been really rewarding. Of all these years, my favourite moments have been the ones in which I was totally freaked out by the sheer size of technical problem at hand. It is because after I was done with these problems, these were the challenges that gave me a huge sense of achievement - not only in my technical abilities, but also in my personal abilities to persevere. It was in these moments I realized the great joy of overcoming your deepest fears and treading deep waters.

I know that a lot of you want or know someone who wants to start learning web development or coding in general. Perhaps you are too afraid to take this bold move, perhaps you think that coding is hard and not sure if you are the right fit. Maybe you are too scared to open the code editor and start coding because you are afraid you may get stuck and lose motivation, or you don't know where to get started in the vast sea of knowledge. I am here to tell you - You got this! We will get through this together!

In this article, I will dive into the resources, a proposed plan of getting started, and a list of resources to help you learn to become a web developer. This plan is going to be focused on getting you a job, and therefore project-heavy.

## Debunking some myths:

## Step up: Pick a stack (Front end vs back end)

Depending on your interest and passion, you may want to focus on front end development or back end development. Front end development is the development of user interfaces, and uses technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript. When foccussing on front end development, you may want to focus on frameworks and libraries such as React, Redux, SASS. In 2021, a good set of libraries to learn is React, SASS <>
Back end development is the development of software that facilitates user interface such as building APIs and uses back end technologies such as NodeJS. For back-end development, you may want to focus on databases such as MongoDB and frameworks and libraries such as NodeJS, Express. In 2021, a good set of libraries to learn is <>
