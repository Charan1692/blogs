# JavaScript Events Handlers â€“ How to handle events in JavaScript

## What are events? 
Events are actions that happen when a user interacts with the page - for eg, clicking an element, typing in a field, loading a page, etc. The browser notifies the system that something has happened, and it needs to be handled. It gets handled by registering a function, called `event handler`, that listens for a particular type of event. 

## What does it mean to "handle an event"? 
To put it in simple terms, consider this - let's assume you are interested in attending Web Development meetups events in your local community. To do this, you sign-up for a local meetup "Women Who Code" and subscribe to notifications, so that anytime a new meetup is scheduled, you get alerted. That is event handling! 

In a browser, you can do this by listening to an event on the page by using event listeners / handlers. Event handlers are functions that listen to a specific event, such as - 

// TODO: give code example
