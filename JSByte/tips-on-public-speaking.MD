# 5 Tips on getting started with public speaking at tech conferences for first time speakers

1. What to talk about if you have nothing to talk about? 
  - Talk about something you are passionate about
  - Talk about a technical problem you have solved at work on in your side project
  - Talk about your side project
  - Talk about a technology you want to learn
  - Find inspiration on YouTube for a potential topic

2. How to find events?
  - Find events on Meetup, Eventbrite, etc. 
  - Find events on Twitter
  - Find events in Github repos that store upcoming conferences information

3. How to know if this is a good topic to talk about? 
  - Browse schedule from previous years to see what common themes people talked about
  - Send a few topics to the conference organizers so they can give you feedback
  - Run the topics by with someone who speaks at conferences a lot. 

4. Nervous about getting up on (virtual) stage. 
  - Do a dry run with a few friends, partner or organizers. 
  - Use presenter notes if you tend to forget lines when you are nervous
  - Keep a script handy
  - Record yourself giving the talk and note down where you can improve
  - Practice the first five minutes of a talk well. I have noticed that if I can get a good start, my nerves are calmed down and I feel a lot more confident in the rest of the talk. 
  - Be honest. So many times people will get up on the stage and declare that they are nervous. Its totally OK! We are all humans and the audience understands. Everyone is rooting for you.  

5. Start small 
  - Give a talk at your local meetup first. 
  - Give a talk in your office network first. 
  - Start with something you are very confident about. 


The feeling you get after having given a great talk is amazing! All the nervousness is worth it.
